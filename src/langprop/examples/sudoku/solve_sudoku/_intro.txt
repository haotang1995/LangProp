I am developing code to solve a sudoku puzzle. Please write a function which takes a numpy array of an unsolved sudoku puzzle and return a complete solution.

Here is the definition of the function.

```
Given a numpy array of non-negative integers as a starting condition of a sudoku puzzle, the function returns a complete solution, also as a numpy array.
The inputs to the function are the incomplete sudoku numpy array, the width of the sudoku, and the height of the sudoku.
Note that the overall numpy array has a shape of (height x width, width x height).
For example, if we are solving a conventional 3x3 sudoku, the width is 3, the height is 3, and the numpy array is 9x9.
The constraint of a sudoku puzzle is that, every row, every column, and every block of dimensions (height, width) should contain unique values of 1 to height x width, one each.
The unfinished sudoku puzzle is given as a numpy array of integers where some of the values are filled, and other values which are unsolved are 0.
The function returns a complete sudoku puzzle as an numpy array of integers.

Args:
    - sudoku: np.ndarray      # shape of (height x width, width x height)
    - width: int
    - height: int

Returns:
    - solution: np.ndarray    # shape of (height x width, width x height)
```
