I am developing code to solve a sudoku puzzle. Please write a function which takes a numpy array of an unsolved sudoku puzzle and return a complete solution.

Here is the definition of the function.

```
Given a numpy array of non-negative integers as a starting condition of a sudoku puzzle, the function returns a complete solution, also as a numpy array.
The inputs to the function are the incomplete sudoku numpy array, the width of the sudoku, and the height of the sudoku.
Note that the overall numpy array has a shape of (height x width, width x height).
For example, if we are solving a conventional 3x3 sudoku, the width is 3, the height is 3, and the numpy array is 9x9.
The constraint of a sudoku puzzle is that, every row, every column, and every block of dimensions (height, width) should contain unique values of 1 to height x width, one each.
The unfinished sudoku puzzle is given as a numpy array of integers where some of the values are filled, and other values which are unsolved are 0.
The function returns a complete sudoku puzzle as an numpy array of integers.

Args:
    - sudoku: np.ndarray      # shape of (height x width, width x height)
    - width: int
    - height: int

Returns:
    - solution: np.ndarray    # shape of (height x width, width x height)
```


Here is an example code that I have written. However, it is not working as expected.

```python
{{ code }}
```

I executed the code, and got an accuracy of {{ int(avg_score * 100) }}%.

$begin
if printed:
    print("There was a print message saying: {{ printed }}")
if exception:
    print("""The code failed to run because there was an exception. The exception message was as follows: {{ exception }}""")
    print("Resolving this exception is the top priority.")
else:
    if {{ same_outputs }}:
        print("""It also seems that the code produces the same output of ```{{ outputs }}``` for all inputs, which is not the behaviour we want.""")

    print("""

The code produced incorrect results for the following inputs. The prediction, ground truth label and score were as follows.

Inputs: sudoku = {{ args[0] }}, width = {{ args[1] }}, height = {{ args[2] }}
Incorrect prediction: solution = {{ outputs }}""")
    if {{ label is not None }}:
        print("""Ground truth label: solution = {{ label[0] }}""")
    print("Score: {{ int(score * 100) }}%")
$end

$begin
if feedback:
    print("""{{ feedback }}""")
$end

Please do the following:

$begin
if exception:
    print("Step 1. Look at the error message carefully and identify the reason why the code failed, and how it can be corrected.")
else:
    print("Step 1. Given the example input and output, identify the reason why the code made a wrong prediction, and how it can be corrected to achieve a good score.")
$end

Step 2. Describe step by step what the code should do in order to achieve its task.
Step 3. Please rewrite the python function `{{ function_name }}` to achieve a higher score, including all necessary import statements.
