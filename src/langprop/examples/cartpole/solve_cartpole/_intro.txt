I am developing code to solve CartPole. Please write a function which takes the position and velocity of the cart, and the angle and angular velocity of the pole, and return the action that the policy should take.

Here is the definition of the function.

```
Given the position and velocity of the cart, and the angle and angular velocity of the pole, return the action that the policy should take to balance the pole on the cart.

Args:
    - cart_position: float          # range of -4.8 to 4.8 [m]
    - cart_velocity: float          # range of -inf to +inf [m/s]
    - pole_angle: float             # range of -0.418 to 0.418 [radian]
    - pole_angular_velocity: float  # range of -inf to +inf [radian/s]

Returns:
    - action: int    # 0 if the cart should be pushed to the left (negative direction), 1 if it should be pushed to the right (positive direction)
```
