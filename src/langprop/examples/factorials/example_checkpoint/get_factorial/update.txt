%% USER
I am developing code to evaluate the factorial of an integer input.

Here is the definition of the function.

```
Given a non-negative integer, return the factorial of that integer.

Args:
    - number: int       # Has to be non-negative

Returns:
    - factorial: int    # Factorial of input number
```


Here is an example code that I have written. However, it is not working as expected.

```python
{{ code }}
```

I executed the code, and got an accuracy of {{ int(avg_score * 100) }}%.

$begin
if printed:
    print("There was a print message saying: {{ printed }}")
if exception:
    print("""The code failed to run because there was an exception. The exception message was as follows: {{ exception }}""")
    print("Resolving this exception is the top priority.")
else:
    if {{ same_outputs }}:
        print("It also seems that the code produces the same output of ```{{ outputs }}``` for all inputs, which is not the behaviour we want.")

    print("""

The code produced incorrect results for the following inputs. The prediction, ground truth label and score were as follows.

Inputs: {{ args[0] }}
Incorrect prediction: factorial = {{ outputs }}""")
    if {{ label }}:
        print("Ground truth label: factorial = {{ label }}")
    print("Score: {{ int(score * 100) }}%")
$end

$begin
if feedback:
    print("""{{ feedback }}""")
$end

Please do the following:

$begin
if exception:
    print("Step 1. Look at the error message carefully and identify the reason why the code failed, and how it can be corrected.")
else:
    print("Step 1. Given the example input and output, identify the reason why the code made a wrong prediction, and how it can be corrected to achieve a good score.")
$end

Step 2. Describe step by step what the code should do in order to achieve its task.
Step 3. Please rewrite the python function `{{ function_name }}` to achieve a higher score, including all necessary import statements.
