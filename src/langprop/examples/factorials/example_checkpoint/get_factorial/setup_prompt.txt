%% USER
I am developing code to evaluate the factorial of an integer input.

Here is the definition of the function.

```
Given a non-negative integer, return the factorial of that integer.

Args:
    - number: int       # Has to be non-negative

Returns:
    - factorial: int    # Factorial of input number
```


This is a template of the code.

```python
def get_factorial(number: int) -> int:
    # Write code here
    return output
```

Please do the following:
Step 1. Describe step by step what the code should do in order to achieve its task.
Step 2. Provide a python code solution that implements your strategy, including all necessary import statements.
